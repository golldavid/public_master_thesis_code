# master-thesis-code

This repository stores coding projects for my master thesis.

'Prisoners-Dilemma': The goal is to implement a program to simulate an N-player iterated PD with multiple learning algorithms and variable complexity of the hyperparameters.

'first_steps' stores a bunch of small unrelated projects which help me to familiarise myself with some fundamental aspects. 
Among other, these include at the moment: <br>
qLearning_tutorial.ipynb: a notebook to work on qlearning algorithm <br>
replicating_Izquierdo.ipynb: a notebook to translate the mathematica code for an interactive widget of the paper https://www.jasss.org/11/2/1.html <br>
